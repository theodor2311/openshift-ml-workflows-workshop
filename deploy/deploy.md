# Deployment instructions

We'll have more documentation for how to run the lab on your own time in the future, but for now you can run the notebooks and build pipelines.  To run our lab on an OpenShift cluster (including on your personal computer with minishift or `oc cluster`), run the following command:

`oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/willb/openshift-ml-workflows-workshop/develop/deploy/templates/resources.yaml`

**Note**:  This workshop is _not yet available_ in RHPDS.  Stay tuned!
